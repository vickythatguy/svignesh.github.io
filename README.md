Predictive models were built using Logistic Regression (97% accuracy) and Random Forest (98% accuracy) to support diabetes prediction. Comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) identified key predictors, including BMI, HbA1c levels, and blood glucose, offering valuable insights into influential factors. Manual oversampling techniques were implemented to balance the dataset and enhance model performance. These efforts generated actionable insights to assist healthcare strategies in early detection and risk assessment, enabling data-driven approaches to patient care.
