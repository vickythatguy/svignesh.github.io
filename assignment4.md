# Assignment 4: Data Story - How is Climate Change Influencing Agricultural Productivity Across Canada?

## Overview
This project investigates the significant impact of climate change on Canadian agriculture, emphasizing changes in productivity, economic challenges, and resource sustainability. Using a scroll storytelling method, the project engages audiences with interactive visuals, narrative text, and real-world insights.

---

## Objective
To highlight the urgent need for sustainable agricultural practices in Canada by illustrating how climate change affects productivity, resource availability, and farmer livelihoods. The project aims to raise awareness and inspire collaborative efforts to address these challenges.

---

## Themes
- **Changes in Agricultural Productivity**: Effects of extreme weather on crop yields.
- **Impacts on Soil and Water Resources**: Rising irrigation costs, soil erosion, and resource management.
- **Economic Challenges for Farmers**: Financial strain from climate variability and disaster recovery costs.

---

## Characters
- **Farmers**: Adapting to unpredictable weather and rising operational costs.
- **Policymakers**: Managing resources and implementing climate-resilient solutions.
- **Consumers**: Experiencing the downstream effects of increased food prices.

---

## Iteration Process

### 1. Research and Data Collection
- Data was sourced from credible organizations like:
  - Statistics Canada
  - Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada
  - Environment and Climate Change Canada
- Focused on datasets related to crop yields, irrigation costs, disaster relief funding, and soil erosion.

### 2. Visual Design and Narrative Building
- Tools like heatmaps, bar charts, and interactive maps were used to create engaging visuals.
- A narrative structure was developed:
  - **Introduction**: Climate change reshapes Canadian agriculture.
  - **Conflict**: Financial and resource challenges strain farmers.
  - **Resolution**: Sustainable practices provide hope for resilience.

## Key Insights
1. Rising temperatures have extended Canadaâ€™s growing season, benefiting some crops but causing heat stress in others.
2. Climate variability has led to fluctuating yields, affecting economic stability for farmers.
3. Droughts and floods have increased irrigation costs and reduced soil moisture, particularly in the Prairies.
