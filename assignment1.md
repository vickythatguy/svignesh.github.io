# Mind Matters: Addressing Mental Health Challenges Among Seniors

## Introduction
For this project, I focused on the mental health challenges faced by seniors, a topic often overlooked despite its significance. Aging individuals face depression, anxiety, and isolation caused by living alone or losing loved ones. These struggles are compounded by physical decline and retirement, leaving many seniors feeling purposeless. While healthcare systems prioritize physical health, emotional well-being often takes a backseat, leading to silent battles for many elderly individuals. 

This project aims to bring attention to these struggles and question whether current healthcare systems provide adequate support. Using data from **Statistics Canada**, the **World Health Organization (WHO)**, and the **Canadian Coalition for Seniors' Mental Health (CCSMH)**, I created interactive presentations and visualizations to make these issues accessible and compelling.

### 3. Datasets and Metrics Iteration
- **Datasets**:
  - Initial: General health data and global reports.
  - Final: Specific data from **NHATS**, **AARP Loneliness Survey**, WHO, and Stats Canada.
- **Metrics**:
  - Prevalence rates of depression and anxiety among seniors.
  - Percentage of seniors receiving mental health care.
  - Social isolation metrics (self-reported loneliness).

### 4. Visual Methods Iteration
- **Initial Idea**: Basic charts and graphs.
- **Final Decision**: Combined bar charts, line charts, and pictographs with personal narratives for accessibility.

### 5. Delivery Format Iteration
- **Initial Idea**: Explored videos, articles, and posters.
- **Final Decision**: Created a **Power BI dashboard** for interactivity and a printable infographic for seniors preferring traditional formats.

## Storyboard Foundation
### Narrative:
- **Introduction**: Ideal picture of aging with seniors enjoying life.
- **Meet Charlie**: A senior facing isolation after his family moved away.
- **Health Struggles**: Isolation impacts Charlieâ€™s mental and physical health.

## Conclusion
The mental health struggles faced by seniors like Charlie are often overlooked. Through this project, I highlighted the prevalence of isolation, depression, and anxiety, and the urgent need for accessible mental health services. Addressing these issues can improve seniors' quality of life, ensuring they live with purpose and connection. Now is the time to act and prioritize the emotional well-being of our elderly population.
